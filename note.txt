When finding subgames, we first take connected components.
We then take the BB of the component, and count the number of stones in the component.
If the BB and size are below a certain level, then we have immediate bounds on the size.
Else, we just use a heuristic (say 2).

We then go through all the connected components, and merge them together if the distance between the parts is less than 4 (or perhaps less if the CCs are very small). Then rinse and repeat. Then that gives us the subgames, which we then solve independently. It might be nice to have a dictionary/lookup table for subgames, but that feels like a lot of work - skip for now.
