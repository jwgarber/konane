# Konane

A simple program for playing konane. Use `make` to compile, and then `./konane6x6` to run. The default board dimension is 6x6. Alternate dimensions can be done using `make X=3 Y=5`, for example.

To solve the game from the start, give 'solve' and 'user colour' as command line arguments. For example: ./konane6x6 solve black
